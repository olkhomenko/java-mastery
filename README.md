# Java Mastery Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my 90-day journey to polish my **Java, clean code, and architecture skills**.  
The goal: write code I'm proud to show, prepare for **senior developer interviews**, and build strong public artifacts.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- 3 polished repositories (katas, concurrency/metrics lab, telemetry service).
- 60+ LeetCode problems solved with clean solutions.
- Demonstrated mastery of clean code, refactoring, concurrency, and architecture.
- Ready for system design and coding interviews.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

katas/ # Small katas (TDD, refactoring, clean code).
docs/ # Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), notes, weekly reviews.
projects/ # Larger sample services (hexagonal architecture, telemetry, etc.).
